## Assignment
> To get started...

### 1) Prompt the user to enter in a positive integer and assign it to a variable of type int
### 2) Write a recursive method to return the sum of the numbers 1 to <your variable>, where <your variable> is a positive integer

- **Tasks**
    - 🍴 base case n = 1
    - 🍴 reduced problem n-1
    - 🍴 general solution n + the sum of 1 + 2 + ... n-1
### 3) Call your recursive method from Main to output the result

- 🔃 The result must include both the number input from the user and the total sum in a sentence that makes sense.
